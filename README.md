# Pin-Shot
It's a simple game that I created on Unity for get experience. 
In this game, you just need to touch the screen or press Space, and shoot a pin into a rotating circle. 
If the pin collides with another pin, you lose.
You can find the build of the game on this repository: https://github.com/Marveee3/PinShot-WebGl
Or you can just play it here: https://marveee3.github.io/PinShot-WebGl/
